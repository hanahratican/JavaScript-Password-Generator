# JavaScript Password Generator
In this project, I created a random password generator using JavaScript.

## Features
The password generator allows you to choose a password that is between 8 and 128 characters long. After selecting your password lenght, it gives you a series of prompts allowing you to choose certain parameters for your password, such as whether to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, or special characters. After going through all the prompts, it will generate a random password for you.
